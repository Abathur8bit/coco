Low resolution graphic mode. Specifically pmode 1, which is 128x96x4 colors. Once initialized, you get 2 graphic pages to work with, and can flip between them. 

# Build
Run `make.bat` to build. 

`blittest.bat` will test the sprite blitter routine. 
`pmode1test.bat` will test the ability to initialize the graphics mode, and page flip.
