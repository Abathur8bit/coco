# Dodge Block

Part of my 26 letter theme game set, where I 
make a game and make the theme based on a letter
of the alphabet. Inpired by John Romero.

Project was first created as a godot project, then 
I decided to port it to the Color Computer 3
as it was a perfect format, and I really liked the
core game play.
