# CMalibu

C version of Malibu dice game, inspired by Tim Hartnell's Giant Book of Computer Games. 
This is a text based game that compiles for the Color Computer 3, Linux, macOS and Windows. 


# Compiling
This compiles on Windows using [pdcurses], Linux and macOS using [curses], and for the [Color Computer][colorcomputer] using cmoc. [pdcurses] is included as a precompiled lib file in ../pdcurses. 

## Windows

**Building** using Visual Studio, **File menu > Open > CMake**, then select the **CMakeLists.txt** file. **Build > Build All** should build it. You should be able to run and debug it like you would a console app. 

**Running** from Visual Studio,  **Debug menu > Start**. On the command prompt, navigate to the project folder, then run **manibu.exe**:

```
cd c:\workspace\malibu
out\build\x86-Debug\malibu.exe
```


## Linux & macOS
**Building** on Linux and macOS requires cmake to be installed. On macOS I actually use CLion which comes with cmake embedded. Linux (Ubuntu) you can can install it via **sudo apt install cmake**, then run the following:

```
cmake -f CMakeLists.txt
make
```

Once built, run with:

```
./malibu
```


## Color Computer
Use [cmoc] to compile to a BIN file that the Color Computer can understand. Once compiled, it will need to be put onto a disk image, then lastly you can run an emulator and mount the disk image. I have used Mame in this example.


### Disk image
Create the disk image using perl. Note that you only have to create the disk image once. You can just copy the BIN file to it without creating it again. 

```
perl -e 'print chr(255) x (35*18*256)' > malibu.dsk
```

### Compile and copy to disk image
I rename the bin file before putting it on the disk image, as the coco only understands 8.3 character filenames. 

```
cmoc malibu.c
mv malibu.bin malibu.bin
writecocofile malibu.dsk malibu.bin
```

### Running
Last but not least, running it. This will start Mame with the disk image mounted, then automatically load and run the program. The first form is used on Linux, the second on Windows. 

```
.\mame64.exe -window coco3 -flop1 malibu.dsk -autoboot_delay 1 -autoboot_command "LOADM\"MALIBU\":EXEC\n"
.\mame64.exe -window coco3 -flop1 malibu.dsk -autoboot_delay 1 -autoboot_command 'LOADM\"MALIBU\":EXEC\n'
```
