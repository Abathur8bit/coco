# Merry 2024
A little holiday game in the vein of Consequences, for the Color Computer. After the initial seed, someone else adds to or changes something, then passes it along to someone else. Once done, maybe we learn something new, or pass a little tidbit of info along.

# History
Coder8Bit created the initial version which had a message scrolling from the top to the bottom of the screen.

Invisibleman added the ability to move a player left and right with the arrow keys, and flash the screen when you hit the space bar.
