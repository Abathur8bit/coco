# Emulator
6809 emulator. Emulates the CPU and memory. Provides a console view of a memory area. 
This isn't meant to be a Color Computer emulator. Instead it provides a foundation
for a debugger; either console based or GUI. I might go console just for a retro
feel. I haven't built a decent console app before so this might be a good project for 
it.

# Goals
First goal is to get the CPU, memory, and unit tests working with a handful of instructions.
Next would be to get a text view of 0x400-0x5FF, the default 32x16 text display of a Coco.

Finish all instructions.

Start working on the debugger part of the project.
